## 10. Integration Testing

  - Haven't figured out yet why its not building the container -> "pipe is broken"
  - Maybe abandon the docker api since it can be very specific
- Need to Create an integration test for a web app that uses a database
  - This should be way closer to the realworld
  - Just use docker-compose

- While this is an important thing to know, it might not be relevant within this context

# Overall todo's
- Time the demo's!
- Make sure all demo's focus on the important part (docker!), low/no code -> keep it docker focussed
- Would be cool to use a js based presentation framework-thing but that might take up too much time.
