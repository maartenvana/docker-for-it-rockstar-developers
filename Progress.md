- While this is an important thing to know, it might not be relevant within this context
- Maybe just mention it in a slide called: "So now what?"

# Overall todo's
- Time the demo's!
- Make sure all demo's focus on the important part (docker!), low/no code -> keep it docker focussed
- Would be cool to use a js based presentation framework-thing but that might take up too much time.
- Add "next steps" in presentation.

- DOCKER COMPOSE: add service name?
- demo: docker exec ?
